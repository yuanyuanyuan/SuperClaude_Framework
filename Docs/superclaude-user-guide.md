│  /sc:load   │────▶│    WORK     │────▶│  /sc:save   │────▶│    NEXT     │
│  (INIT)     │     │  (ACTIVE)   │     │ (CHECKPOINT)│     │  SESSION    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                                                              │
       └──────────────────── Enhanced Context ───────────────────────┘
```

### Session States

**1. INITIALIZING** (`/sc:load`)
- Activate project via Serena memory system
- Load existing memories and context
- Initialize session metadata and tracking
- **Performance Target**: <500ms

**2. ACTIVE** (Working Session)
- Full project context available
- Changes tracked for persistence
- Decisions logged for replay
- Automatic checkpoint triggers

**3. CHECKPOINTED** (`/sc:save`)
- Analyze session changes and insights  
- Persist discoveries to memory
- Create checkpoint records
- Generate summaries if requested

**4. RESUMED** (Next `/sc:load`)
- Load latest checkpoint and context
- Restore session state and data
- Display resumption summary
- Continue from previous state

### Key Session Commands

**`/sc:load` - Session Initialization**
```bash
/sc:load                    # Initialize current project
/sc:load --deep            # Deep context loading
/sc:load --resume          # Resume from last checkpoint
```

**`/sc:save` - Session Persistence**
```bash
/sc:save                    # Save current session state
/sc:save --checkpoint       # Create checkpoint
/sc:save --summarize        # Include session summary
```

**`/sc:reflect` - Session Analysis**
```bash
/sc:reflect --type task     # Validate current task
/sc:reflect --type session # Analyze session progress
/sc:reflect --type completion # Check if work is complete
```

### Automatic Checkpoints

SuperClaude automatically creates checkpoints:
- **Task-Based**: Major task completion

## The Orchestrator System 🎯

The orchestrator is SuperClaude's intelligent routing system that tries to analyze your requests and coordinate a good combination of tools, personas, and integrations. It's what hopefully makes SuperClaude feel smart and responsive rather than just a collection of separate tools.

### How the Orchestrator Works 🔄

**Think of it as a smart dispatcher** that:
1. **Analyzes** your request to understand intent and complexity
2. **Routes** to the best combination of commands, flags, personas, and MCP servers
3. **Coordinates** execution for optimal results
4. **Validates** through quality gates to ensure good outcomes
5. **Optimizes** performance and resource usage

### Detection Engine 🧠

The detection engine analyzes every request through multiple lenses:

#### Pattern Recognition

**Complexity Detection**:
- **Simple**: Single file operations, basic tasks (<3 steps) → Direct execution
- **Moderate**: Multi-file operations, analysis tasks (3-10 steps) → Standard routing
- **Complex**: System-wide changes, architectural decisions (>10 steps) → Advanced orchestration

**Domain Identification**:
- **Frontend**: Keywords like "UI", "component", "responsive" → 🎨 frontend persona + Magic MCP
- **Backend**: Keywords like "API", "database", "service" → ⚙️ backend persona + Context7 MCP
- **Security**: Keywords like "vulnerability", "auth", "compliance" → 🛡️ security persona + Sequential MCP
- **Performance**: Keywords like "slow", "optimize", "bottleneck" → ⚡ performance persona + Playwright MCP

**Operation Type Classification**:
- **Analysis**: "analyze", "review", "understand" → Sequential MCP + analyzer persona
- **Creation**: "create", "build", "implement" → Magic MCP (if UI) or Context7 (patterns)
- **Modification**: "improve", "refactor", "optimize" → Appropriate specialist persona
- **Debugging**: "troubleshoot", "fix", "debug" → Sequential MCP + analyzer persona

#### Auto-Activation Logic

**High-Confidence Triggers** (90%+ activation):
```bash
/sc:analyze auth-system/ --focus security
# → 🛡️ security persona + Sequential MCP + --validate flag
```

**Context-Based Activation**:
```bash
/sc:build react-components/
# → 🎨 frontend persona + Magic MCP + --c7 flag (React docs)
```

**Performance-Based Activation**:
```bash
# When context usage >75%
/sc:analyze large-project/
# → Auto-adds --uc flag for compression
```

### Routing Intelligence 🚦

The routing system uses dynamic decision trees to map detected patterns to optimal tool combinations.

#### Master Routing Table

| Request Pattern | Usually Auto-Activates | How Often | Why |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-----|
| "analyze architecture" | 🏗️ architect + --ultrathink + Sequential | Most times | Complex system analysis |
| "create UI component" | 🎨 frontend + Magic + --uc | Pretty often | Frontend domain with generation |
| "security audit" | 🛡️ security + --ultrathink + Sequential | Most times | Security expertise needed |
| "debug complex issue" | 🔍 analyzer + --think + Sequential | Often | Investigation methodology |
| "improve performance" | ⚡ performance + --think-hard + Playwright | Pretty often | Performance expertise + testing |

#### Intelligent Coordination

**Multi-Server Operations**:
```bash
/sc:design user-dashboard --type api
```
**Orchestrator usually coordinates**:
- 🏗️ architect persona (system design)
- 🎨 frontend persona (UI design) 
- Context7 MCP (framework patterns)
- Sequential MCP (design methodology)

**Fallback Strategies**:
- Context7 unavailable → WebSearch for documentation → Manual implementation
- Sequential timeout → Native Claude analysis → Note limitations
- Magic failure → Basic component generation → Suggest manual enhancement

### Quality Gates & Validation Framework ✅

SuperClaude tries to implement an 8-step validation cycle for operations:

#### 8-Step Quality Process

1. **Syntax Validation** - Language parsers + Context7 standards
2. **Type Checking** - Sequential analysis + compatibility verification
3. **Linting** - Context7 rules + quality analysis
4. **Security Review** - Sequential analysis + OWASP compliance
5. **Testing** - Playwright E2E + coverage analysis (aiming for good coverage)
6. **Performance** - Sequential analysis + benchmarking
7. **Documentation** - Context7 patterns + completeness validation
8. **Integration** - Playwright testing + deployment validation

#### Validation Automation

**Continuous Integration**:
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Progressive validation with early failure detection
- Evidence generation with comprehensive metrics

**Intelligent Monitoring**:
- Success rate tracking with ML prediction
- Adaptive validation based on historical patterns
- Automatic optimization of validation strategies

### Performance Optimization ⚡

The orchestrator tries to optimize for good performance through several strategies:

#### Resource Management

**Token Allocation**:
- Detection Engine: 1-2K tokens for pattern analysis
- Decision Trees: 500-1K tokens for routing logic
- MCP Coordination: Variable based on activated servers
- Reserve: 10% buffer for unexpected complexity

**Operation Batching**:
- **Parallel execution** when no dependencies exist
- **Context sharing** across related operations
- **Cache strategies** for successful routing patterns
- **Smart queuing** to prevent resource exhaustion

#### Advanced Orchestration

**Sub-Agent Delegation**:
```bash
# Auto-activates when >7 directories or >50 files detected
/sc:analyze monorepo/
# → --delegate auto flag + parallel processing
```

**Wave Orchestration**:
```bash
# Auto-activates when complexity >0.7 + files >20 + operation types >2
/sc:improve legacy-system/
# → --wave-mode auto + multi-stage execution
```

### Real-World Orchestration Examples 💡

#### Example 1: Security Analysis Request
```bash
/sc:analyze user-auth/ --focus security
```

**Orchestrator Analysis**:
- Domain: Security (high confidence)
- Complexity: Moderate (authentication system)
- Operation: Analysis + scanning

**Usually coordinates**:
- 🛡️ security persona (threat modeling perspective)
- Sequential MCP (systematic analysis)
- --validate flag (pre-operation safety check)
- --think flag (complex security patterns)

**Quality Gates**: All 8 steps with emphasis on security validation

#### Example 2: Frontend Performance Optimization
```bash
/sc:improve slow-dashboard/ --focus performance
```

**Orchestrator Analysis**:
- Domain: Frontend + Performance (dual expertise needed)
- Complexity: High (performance optimization)
- Operation: Improvement + validation

**Usually coordinates**:
- ⚡ performance persona (primary)
- 🎨 frontend persona (secondary, if UI detected)
- Playwright MCP (performance testing)
- --think-hard flag (complex optimization)

**Quality Gates**: Performance-focused validation with benchmarking

#### Example 3: Large Codebase Analysis  
```bash
/sc:analyze enterprise-monorepo/
```

**Orchestrator Analysis**:
- Scope: Large (>50 files detected)
- Complexity: High (enterprise-scale)
- Resources: High token usage predicted

**Usually coordinates**:
- --delegate auto flag (parallel processing)
- --uc flag (token optimization)
- 🏗️ architect persona (system-level analysis)
- Sequential MCP (structured analysis)

**Quality Gates**: Distributed validation across sub-agents

### Orchestrator Configuration ⚙️

**Performance Settings**:
```yaml
orchestrator_config:
  enable_caching: true
  parallel_operations: true
  max_parallel: 3
  token_reserve: 10%
  emergency_threshold: 90%
```

**Intelligence Settings**:

## Rules & Principles 📏

SuperClaude operates according to core rules and principles that ensure consistent, reliable, and helpful behavior. Understanding these helps you predict how SuperClaude will approach problems and why it makes certain decisions.

### Core Operational Rules ⚖️

These are the core rules that SuperClaude tries to follow:

#### File Operation Security 🔐
- **Always Read before Write/Edit** - SuperClaude never modifies files without understanding current content
- **Use absolute paths only** - Prevents path traversal attacks and ensures reliable file operations
- **Never auto-commit** - SuperClaude won't commit changes to git unless explicitly requested
- **Prefer batch operations** - Multiple related changes are grouped for consistency

**Why this matters**: These rules prevent data loss, security vulnerabilities, and unintended modifications to your codebase.

#### Task Management Rules 📋
- **Evidence-based progress** - Tasks are only marked complete when there's measurable evidence
- **Single focus protocol** - Only one task is "in_progress" at a time for clarity
- **Quality gates** - All operations include validation steps before completion
- **Context retention** - Tries to preserve context well across operations

**Why this matters**: Ensures reliable progress tracking and prevents work from being lost or forgotten.

#### Framework Compliance Rules 🎯
- **Check dependencies first** - Always verify package.json/requirements.txt before using libraries
- **Follow existing patterns** - Respect project conventions, import styles, and architecture
- **Systematic codebase changes** - Complete discovery before making project-wide modifications
- **Validate completion** - Verify changes work and don't break existing functionality

**Why this matters**: Maintains code quality and consistency with your existing project structure.

/sc:analyze backend-api/ --persona-security  
# → Override with explicit persona choice

# Not enough analysis depth
/sc:troubleshoot complex-issue --ultrathink --all-mcp
# → Force maximum capabilities
```

#### Optimizing Coordination
```bash
# Start simple, add complexity as needed
/sc:analyze code.js                    # Basic analysis
/sc:analyze code.js --think            # Add thinking
/sc:analyze code.js --think --c7       # Add documentation
/sc:analyze code.js --think --c7 --seq # Add systematic analysis
```

#### Understanding Coordination Decisions
```bash
# See why certain tools were chosen
/sc:analyze complex-system/ --introspect
# → Shows decision-making process and tool selection reasoning
```

### Best Practices for Integration 💡

#### Let Auto-Coordination Work First
- Trust SuperClaude's automatic tool selection
- Override only when you need specific perspectives
- Start with simple commands and add flags as needed

#### Understand Flag Interactions
- Some flags override others (`--no-mcp` overrides `--c7`, `--seq`)
- Safety flags take precedence over optimization flags
- Persona flags can be overridden by more specific persona requests

#### Use Appropriate Scope
- File-level: Single persona + minimal MCP
- Module-level: Domain personas + relevant MCP
- System-level: Multiple personas + full MCP coordination

#### Monitor Resource Usage
- Large operations → Use `--uc` and `--delegate`
- Simple tasks → Use `--no-mcp` and `--answer-only`
- Critical operations → Use `--safe-mode` and `--validate`

The key is understanding that SuperClaude's intelligence comes from the coordination between its components. The automatic coordination works well most of the time, but knowing how to control it gives you the flexibility to handle any situation.

## Tips & Best Practices 🎯

Based on real-world usage patterns and successful workflows, here are practical tips for getting the most out of SuperClaude.

### Starting Out Successfully 🚀

#### Begin with Simple Commands
```bash
# Start here - basic functionality
/sc:help
/sc:analyze README.md
/sc:build --help

# Not here - complex orchestration
/sc:improve entire-codebase/ --wave-mode force --all-mcp --delegate auto
```

**Why**: Understanding basic behavior before adding complexity prevents confusion and helps you learn the framework gradually.

#### Trust Auto-Activation First
```bash
# Let SuperClaude choose tools
/sc:analyze auth-system/  
# → Watch what auto-activates (likely security persona + validation)

# Then experiment with manual control
/sc:analyze auth-system/ --persona-performance
# → See different perspective on same code
```

**Why**: Auto-activation usually gets it right and shows you optimal tool combinations for different scenarios.

#### Use Preview and Safe Modes
```bash
# See what would happen first
/sc:improve messy-code.js --preview

# Apply changes safely  
/sc:improve messy-code.js --safe-mode

# For critical code, use both
/sc:improve production-auth/ --preview --safe-mode --validate
```

**Why**: Prevents unintended changes and helps you understand what SuperClaude will do before it does it.

### Flag Usage Patterns 🏁

#### Start Simple, Add Complexity
```bash
# Basic command
/sc:analyze complex-system/

# Add thinking if needed
/sc:analyze complex-system/ --think

# Add documentation if external libraries involved
/sc:analyze complex-system/ --think --c7

# Full analysis for critical systems
/sc:analyze complex-system/ --think-hard --c7 --seq --validate
```

**Why**: Incremental complexity helps you understand what each flag adds and avoids over-engineering simple problems.

#### Common Flag Combinations That Work
```bash
# Safe improvement workflow
/sc:improve --preview → /improve --safe-mode → /test --coverage

# Deep investigation workflow  
/sc:troubleshoot issue --think --seq → /analyze affected-code/ --focus quality

# Learning and documentation workflow
/sc:explain concept --persona-mentor --verbose --c7

# Performance optimization workflow
/sc:analyze --focus performance --persona-performance --play
```

**Why**: These combinations are proven patterns that work well together and don't conflict.

#### Avoid Flag Conflicts
```bash
# ❌ Conflicting flags
/sc:analyze code/ --no-mcp --c7  # --no-mcp overrides --c7

# ❌ Counterproductive combinations
/sc:analyze small-file.js --ultrathink --all-mcp  # Overkill for simple tasks

# ✅ Sensible combinations
/sc:analyze large-system/ --think --delegate auto  # Appropriate for complexity
/sc:analyze simple-utility.js --answer-only       # Appropriate for simplicity
```

**Why**: Understanding flag precedence and interactions prevents unexpected behavior and wasted resources.

### Persona Optimization 🎭

#### Let Domain Auto-Activation Work
```bash
# These will automatically get the right persona
/sc:build react-components/     # → frontend persona
/sc:scan auth/ --focus security # → security persona  
/sc:troubleshoot slow-api/      # → performance + analyzer personas
```

**Why**: Auto-activation is based on proven patterns and usually selects the most appropriate expertise.

#### Manual Override for Different Perspectives
```bash
# Get different viewpoints on same code
/sc:analyze payment-flow/ --persona-security    # Security perspective
/sc:analyze payment-flow/ --persona-performance # Performance perspective
/sc:analyze payment-flow/ --persona-architect   # Architecture perspective
```

**Why**: Different personas provide unique insights that can reveal issues or opportunities others might miss.

#### Use Appropriate Personas for Project Phases
```bash
# Planning phase
/sc:design new-feature --persona-architect

# Implementation phase  
/sc:build feature/ --persona-frontend  # or backend, etc.

# Testing phase
/sc:test feature/ --persona-qa

# Documentation phase
/sc:document feature/ --persona-scribe
```

**Why**: Each project phase benefits from different types of expertise and perspectives.

### MCP Server Strategy 🔧

#### Understand When Each Server Helps
- **Context7**: When working with frameworks, libraries, or need official documentation
- **Sequential**: For complex debugging, systematic analysis, or architectural decisions  
- **Magic**: For UI component generation, design systems, or frontend development
- **Playwright**: For testing, performance measurement, or browser automation

#### Optimize for Performance vs. Capabilities
```bash
# Fast execution for simple tasks
/sc:analyze simple-script.js --no-mcp

# Comprehensive analysis for complex problems
/sc:analyze complex-system/ --all-mcp --think-hard

# Balanced approach for most work
/sc:analyze typical-component/ --c7  # Just documentation lookup
```

**Why**: Matching MCP usage to task complexity optimizes both speed and quality of results.

### Workflow Optimization 📈

#### Use Progressive Enhancement
```bash
# Level 1: Basic analysis
/sc:analyze component.js

# Level 2: Add thinking if complex
/sc:analyze component.js --think

# Level 3: Add documentation for frameworks
/sc:analyze component.js --think --c7

# Level 4: Full analysis for critical code
/sc:analyze component.js --think-hard --c7 --seq --validate
```

**Why**: Start with what you need and add complexity only when necessary. Prevents over-engineering and saves time.

#### Batch Related Operations
```bash
# ✅ Efficient: Related operations together
/sc:analyze auth-system/ --focus security
/sc:improve auth-system/ --focus security --safe-mode  
/sc:test auth-system/ --type security

# ❌ Inefficient: Scattered operations
/sc:analyze auth-system/
/sc:review different-system/
/sc:improve auth-system/  # Context lost between operations
```

**Why**: Batching related work maintains context and allows SuperClaude to build on previous analysis.

#### Use Appropriate Scope
```bash
# File-level for specific issues
/sc:improve single-component.js --focus performance

# Module-level for related functionality
/sc:analyze user-auth/ --scope module

# Project-level for architectural concerns
/sc:analyze --scope project --focus architecture

# System-level only when necessary
/sc:analyze --scope system --delegate auto --uc
```

**Why**: Matching scope to problem prevents both under-analysis and resource waste.

### Performance and Efficiency 🏃‍♂️

#### Manage Context and Token Usage
```bash
# For large operations, use compression
/sc:analyze huge-codebase/ --uc --delegate auto

# For repeated analysis, cache results
/sc:load project-context/  # Cache project understanding
/sc:analyze specific-issue/  # Build on cached context

# For simple questions, minimize overhead
/sc:explain quick-concept --answer-only --no-mcp
```

**Why**: Token efficiency keeps operations fast and prevents context overflow in large projects.

#### Use Delegation for Large Projects
```bash
# Automatically delegate when appropriate
/sc:analyze monorepo/ --delegate auto

# Manual delegation for specific needs
/sc:analyze large-project/ --delegate folders --concurrency 3

# Skip delegation for small projects
/sc:analyze small-app/ --no-delegate
```

**Why**: Delegation provides significant speedup (40-70%) for large-scale operations while maintaining quality.

#### Optimize Command Sequences
```bash
# ✅ Efficient sequence
/sc:load project/           # Understand context once
/sc:analyze --focus quality # Build on understanding
/sc:improve --safe-mode     # Apply improvements
/sc:test --coverage         # Validate changes

# ❌ Inefficient sequence  
/sc:analyze file1.js
/sc:analyze file2.js        # Duplicate setup
/sc:analyze file3.js        # Lost optimization opportunities
```

**Why**: Sequential commands can build on each other's context and analysis for better results.

### Quality and Safety 🛡️

#### Always Validate Important Changes
```bash
# For production code
/sc:improve production-auth/ --safe-mode --validate --preview

# For experimental features
/sc:improve experimental-feature/ --validate

# For learning/exploration
/sc:improve test-code/ --preview  # See what it would do
```

**Why**: Validation prevents breaking changes and helps you understand the impact of modifications.

#### Use Quality Gates Effectively
```bash
# Let quality gates run automatically
/sc:build production-app/  # 8-step validation process runs

# Add extra validation for critical systems
/sc:build payment-system/ --validate --safe-mode

# Skip validation only for experimental work
/sc:build prototype/ --no-validate  # Use sparingly
```

**Why**: Quality gates catch issues early when they're cheaper and easier to fix.

#### Maintain Evidence Trail
```bash
# Commands that provide evidence
/sc:analyze --focus performance  # → Performance metrics
/sc:test --coverage             # → Coverage reports  
/sc:scan --focus security       # → Security assessment

# Use introspection for complex decisions
/sc:analyze complex-system/ --introspect  # → Decision reasoning
```

**Why**: Evidence-based development leads to better decisions and easier debugging when issues arise.

### Learning and Growth 📚

#### Use Mentor Persona for Learning
```bash
# Learn new concepts
/sc:explain GraphQL --persona-mentor --verbose

# Understand complex code
/sc:analyze complex-algorithm.js --persona-mentor

# Get step-by-step guidance
/sc:build new-feature/ --persona-mentor --plan
```

**Why**: Mentor persona optimizes for understanding and knowledge transfer rather than just task completion.

#### Experiment with Different Approaches
```bash
# Try different personas on same problem
/sc:analyze api-design/ --persona-architect
/sc:analyze api-design/ --persona-security
/sc:analyze api-design/ --persona-performance

# Compare tool combinations
/sc:build app/ --magic --c7
/sc:build app/ --no-mcp --uc  # Faster but simpler
```

**Why**: Understanding different approaches helps you choose the best tools for different situations.

#### Build Your Own Patterns
```bash
# Identify what works for your workflow
# Security-focused API development
/sc:design api --persona-security --validate
/sc:build api --persona-backend --c7
/sc:test api --type security --play

# Create your own efficient combinations
/sc:analyze code/ --think --c7 --safe-mode  # Your personal "thorough analysis"
```

**Why**: Developing your own proven patterns increases productivity and ensures consistent quality.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️

#### Don't Over-Engineer Simple Tasks
```bash
# ❌ Overkill for simple tasks
/sc:analyze simple-utility.js --ultrathink --all-mcp --wave-mode force

# ✅ Appropriate for simple tasks  
/sc:analyze simple-utility.js --focus quality
```

#### Don't Ignore Auto-Activation Wisdom
```bash
# ❌ Fighting the system
/sc:build react-app/ --persona-backend --no-magic  # Wrong tools for the job

# ✅ Working with the system
/sc:build react-app/  # Let frontend persona and Magic activate automatically
```

#### Don't Skip Safety for Speed
```bash
# ❌ Risky for important code
/sc:improve production-auth/ --force --no-validate

# ✅ Balanced approach
/sc:improve production-auth/ --safe-mode --validate  # Safer but still efficient
```

#### Don't Use Flags You Don't Understand
```bash
# ❌ Cargo cult flag usage
/sc:command --random-flags-that-look-important

# ✅ Understand what each flag does
/sc:command --think  # Because I need deeper analysis
/sc:command --c7     # Because I'm working with external libraries
```

### Measuring Success 📊

Track what works well for your specific needs:

- **Speed**: How quickly do different flag combinations complete?
- **Quality**: Which approaches produce better results for your type of work?
- **Learning**: Which combinations help you understand problems better?
- **Safety**: Which patterns prevent issues in your environment?

Remember: SuperClaude learns from successful patterns, so using effective combinations consistently helps the framework get better at auto-activation for your specific workflow.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues 🚨

When SuperClaude doesn't work as expected, here's how to diagnose and fix common problems.

### Command Issues 🛠️

#### Commands Not Working as Expected

**Problem**: Command produces unexpected results or seems to ignore your request.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what auto-activated
/sc:analyze code.js --introspect
# → Shows decision-making process

# Try with explicit control
/sc:analyze code.js --persona-analyzer --think --seq
# → Override auto-activation
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Be more specific about what you want
/sc:improve code.js --focus performance --safe-mode

# Use preview to understand what will happen
/sc:improve code.js --preview

# Start simple and add complexity
/sc:analyze code.js                    # Basic
/sc:analyze code.js --think            # Add depth
/sc:analyze code.js --think --c7       # Add documentation
```

**Common Causes**:
- Auto-activation chose different tools than you expected
- Request was too vague for SuperClaude to understand intent
- Complexity mismatch (simple request with complex flags or vice versa)

#### Commands Running Too Slowly

**Problem**: Operations take much longer than expected.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what's activated
/sc:analyze large-project/ --introspect
# → See what tools and servers are being used

# Monitor resource usage
/sc:analyze large-project/ --verbose
# → Shows detailed execution steps
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Optimize for speed
/sc:analyze large-project/ --uc --no-mcp --scope module

# Use delegation for large operations
/sc:analyze huge-codebase/ --delegate auto --concurrency 3

# Reduce scope
/sc:analyze specific-component.js  # Instead of entire project

# Disable expensive features
/sc:analyze code/ --no-mcp --answer-only
```

**Performance Optimization Priority**:
1. Reduce scope (`--scope file` vs `--scope project`)
2. Use compression (`--uc`)
3. Disable MCP servers (`--no-mcp`)
4. Use delegation (`--delegate auto`)
5. Use answer-only mode (`--answer-only`)

#### Commands Producing Too Much Output

**Problem**: Information overload, hard to find relevant information.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use compression
/sc:analyze large-system/ --uc

# Be more specific about focus
/sc:analyze system/ --focus security  # Instead of general analysis

# Use answer-only for simple questions
/sc:explain concept --answer-only

# Limit scope
/sc:analyze --scope file specific-issue.js
```

### Flag Issues 🏁

#### Flag Conflicts and Unexpected Behavior

**Problem**: Flags don't seem to work or produce unexpected results.

**Common Conflicts**:
```bash
# ❌ These conflict
/sc:command --no-mcp --c7        # --no-mcp overrides --c7
/sc:command --answer-only --plan # --answer-only skips planning
/sc:command --uc --verbose       # --uc overrides --verbose

# ✅ These work together
/sc:command --think --c7 --seq   # Complementary capabilities
/sc:command --safe-mode --validate --preview  # Layered safety
```

**Flag Precedence Order**:
1. Safety flags (`--safe-mode`) > optimization flags
2. Explicit flags > auto-activation  
3. `--no-mcp` overrides all individual MCP flags
4. Last specified persona wins
5. Scope: system > project > module > file

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what flags are actually active
/sc:command args --introspect
# → Shows final flag configuration after precedence resolution
```

#### Auto-Activation Issues

**Problem**: Wrong flags or personas auto-activate.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Override auto-activation explicitly
/sc:analyze frontend-code/ --persona-security  # Force security view
/sc:build project/ --no-mcp                    # Force native tools only

# Use more specific language
/sc:analyze "security vulnerabilities in auth system"  # Clear intent
# vs
/sc:analyze auth system                                # Ambiguous

# Check what keywords trigger auto-activation
/sc:help analyze  # Shows auto-activation patterns
```

**Auto-Activation Debugging**:
```bash
# See why certain flags activated
/sc:troubleshoot "why did --think-hard activate?" --introspect
```

### Persona Issues 🎭

#### Wrong Persona Activated

**Problem**: SuperClaude uses the wrong specialist for your needs.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what triggered persona activation
/sc:analyze code/ --introspect
# → Shows persona selection reasoning
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Override with explicit persona
/sc:analyze backend-api/ --persona-security  # Security view of backend code
/sc:analyze ui-component/ --persona-performance  # Performance view of frontend

# Use more specific language
/sc:analyze "security issues in payment processing"  # Triggers security persona
/sc:analyze "slow database queries"                  # Triggers performance persona

# Try different personas for different perspectives
/sc:analyze payment-system/ --persona-security    # Security view
/sc:analyze payment-system/ --persona-architect   # Architecture view
```

#### Persona Doesn't Seem Active

**Problem**: Expected persona behavior but getting generic responses.

**Check Persona Activation**:
```bash
# Verify persona is active
/sc:analyze auth/ --persona-security --introspect
# → Should show security-focused reasoning

# Check if domain keywords are clear
/sc:scan authentication --focus security  # Should auto-activate security persona
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Be explicit about persona and focus
/sc:analyze code/ --persona-security --focus security

# Use appropriate commands for personas
/sc:scan --persona-security     # Security scanning
/sc:test --persona-qa           # Quality-focused testing
/sc:document --persona-scribe   # Professional documentation
```

### MCP Server Issues 🔧

#### MCP Servers Not Activating

**Problem**: Expected MCP capabilities but they don't seem to work.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check MCP server status
/sc:troubleshoot "MCP servers not working" --introspect

# Verify MCP installation
/sc:load --summary  # Should show available MCP servers

# Test specific servers
/sc:analyze react-app/ --c7     # Should use Context7
/sc:troubleshoot issue --seq    # Should use Sequential
/sc:build ui/ --magic           # Should use Magic
/sc:test app/ --play            # Should use Playwright
```

**Common Solutions**:
```bash
# Force MCP activation
/sc:analyze code/ --all-mcp

# Check if servers are disabled
/sc:analyze code/ --c7  # If this doesn't work, Context7 may be unavailable

# Use fallback approaches
/sc:analyze react-app/ --no-mcp  # Use native tools if MCP unavailable
```

#### MCP Servers Too Slow

**Problem**: MCP server integration causes slow performance.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Disable MCP for speed
/sc:analyze large-project/ --no-mcp

# Use selective MCP activation
/sc:analyze react-code/ --magic --no-seq  # Only UI generation, skip analysis

# Optimize MCP usage
/sc:analyze code/ --uc --c7  # Compression + documentation only
```

### Performance Issues ⚡

#### Operations Using Too Many Tokens

**Problem**: Hitting context limits or expensive operations.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Enable compression automatically
/sc:analyze huge-project/ --uc

# Reduce scope
/sc:analyze --scope module specific-area/
/sc:analyze --scope file specific-file.js

# Use delegation
/sc:analyze large-codebase/ --delegate auto --uc

# Disable expensive features
/sc:analyze code/ --no-mcp --answer-only
```

#### Memory or Resource Issues

**Problem**: Operations failing or very slow due to resource constraints.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Reduce concurrency
/sc:analyze large-project/ --delegate auto --concurrency 1

# Use safe mode
/sc:improve large-system/ --safe-mode  # More conservative resource usage

# Break work into smaller chunks
/sc:analyze module1/
/sc:analyze module2/
/sc:analyze module3/
# Instead of /analyze entire-project/
```

### Quality and Safety Issues 🛡️

#### Unsafe or Risky Suggestions

**Problem**: SuperClaude suggests changes that seem risky.

**Always Use Safety Features**:
```bash
# Preview before applying
/sc:improve important-code/ --preview

# Use safe mode for critical code
/sc:improve production-auth/ --safe-mode

# Add validation
/sc:improve system/ --validate --safe-mode

# Use iterative approach
/sc:improve complex-system/ --loop --safe-mode
```

#### Changes Breaking Functionality

**Problem**: Applied improvements cause issues.

**Prevention**:
```bash
# Always use preview first
/sc:improve code/ --preview

# Use safe mode
/sc:improve code/ --safe-mode

# Test after changes
/sc:improve code/ --safe-mode && /test code/
```

**Recovery**:
- Use git to revert changes
- Apply improvements incrementally with `--safe-mode`
- Use `--validate` to check before applying changes

### Framework and Integration Issues 🔗

#### SuperClaude Doesn't Understand Project Context

**Problem**: Recommendations don't fit your project's patterns or constraints.

**Solutions**:

# Load project context first
/sc:load --deep --summary

# Be explicit about project type
/sc:analyze react-typescript-app/ --c7  # Include tech stack in description

# Use appropriate personas
/sc:analyze node-api/ --persona-backend
/sc:analyze react-ui/ --persona-frontend
```

#### Inconsistent Results

**Problem**: Same command produces different results at different times.

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what's auto-activating differently
/sc:command args --introspect

# Use explicit flags for consistency
/sc:analyze code/ --persona-analyzer --think --c7  # Explicit configuration
```

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Be more explicit about requirements
/sc:improve code/ --focus performance --persona-performance --safe-mode

# Use consistent flag patterns
/sc:analyze --think --c7     # Your standard thorough analysis
/sc:improve --safe-mode      # Your standard safe improvement
```
