# Behavioral changes:
# - Hierarchical task breakdown (Plan → Phase → Task → Todo)
# - Progress tracking with TodoWrite integration
# - Session persistence and checkpointing
# - Cross-session context maintenance

# Task hierarchy creation:
# Plan: Complete microservices platform
# ├─ Phase 1: Core infrastructure (auth, API gateway)
# ├─ Phase 2: Service mesh and communication
# ├─ Phase 3: Monitoring and observability
# └─ Phase 4: Integration testing and deployment

# Memory integration across phases:

# Product catalog phase  
/sc:load "auth-phase-complete" && /sc:implement "product catalog API" && /sc:save "catalog-phase-complete"

# Payment integration phase
/sc:load "catalog-phase-complete" && /sc:implement "Stripe payment integration" && /sc:save "payment-phase-complete"

# Each phase builds on previous context while maintaining session continuity
```

### Cross-Session Learning and Adaptation
```bash
# Session with decision tracking and learning
