# SuperClaude Agents Guide 🤖

SuperClaude provides 14 domain specialist agents that Claude Code can invoke for specialized expertise.


## 🧪 Testing Agent Activation

Before using this guide, verify agent selection works:

```bash
# Test manual agent invocation
@agent-python-expert "explain decorators"
# Example behavior: Python expert responds with detailed explanation

# Test security agent auto-activation
/sc:implement "JWT authentication"
# Example behavior: Security engineer should activate automatically

# Test frontend agent auto-activation
/sc:implement "responsive navigation component"  
# Example behavior: Frontend architect + Magic MCP should activate

# Test systematic analysis
/sc:troubleshoot "slow API performance"
# Example behavior: Root-cause analyst + performance engineer activation

# Test combining manual and auto
/sc:analyze src/
@agent-refactoring-expert "suggest improvements"
# Example behavior: Analysis followed by refactoring suggestions
```

**If tests fail**: Check agent files exist in `~/.claude/agents/` or restart Claude Code session

## Core Concepts

### What are SuperClaude Agents?
**Agents** are specialized AI domain experts implemented as context instructions that modify Claude Code's behavior. Each agent is a carefully crafted `.md` file in the `SuperClaude/Agents/` directory containing domain-specific expertise, behavioral patterns, and problem-solving approaches.

**Important**: Agents are NOT separate AI models or software - they are context configurations that Claude Code reads to adopt specialized behaviors.

### Two Ways to Use Agents

#### 1. Manual Invocation with @agent- Prefix
```bash
# Directly invoke a specific agent
@agent-security "review authentication implementation"
@agent-frontend "design responsive navigation"
@agent-architect "plan microservices migration"
```

#### 2. Auto-Activation (Behavioral Routing)
"Auto-activation" means Claude Code reads behavioral instructions to engage appropriate contexts based on keywords and patterns in your requests. SuperClaude provides behavioral guidelines that Claude follows to route to the most appropriate specialists.

> **📝 How Agent "Auto-Activation" Works**: 
> Agent activation isn't automatic system logic - it's behavioral instructions in context files. 
> When documentation says agents "auto-activate", it means Claude Code reads instructions to engage 
> specific domain expertise based on keywords and patterns in your request. This creates the 
> experience of intelligent routing while being transparent about the underlying mechanism.

```bash
# These commands auto-activate relevant agents
/sc:implement "JWT authentication"  # → security-engineer auto-activates
/sc:design "React dashboard"        # → frontend-architect auto-activates
/sc:troubleshoot "memory leak"      # → performance-engineer auto-activates
```

**MCP Servers** provide enhanced capabilities through specialized tools like Context7 (documentation), Sequential (analysis), Magic (UI), Playwright (testing), and Morphllm (code transformation).

**Domain Specialists** focus on narrow expertise areas to provide deeper, more accurate solutions than generalist approaches.

### Agent Selection Rules

**Priority Hierarchy:**
1. **Manual Override** - @agent-[name] takes precedence over auto-activation
2. **Keywords** - Direct domain terminology triggers primary agents
3. **File Types** - Extensions activate language/framework specialists  
4. **Complexity** - Multi-step tasks engage coordination agents
5. **Context** - Related concepts trigger complementary agents

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Manual invocation → Specified agent takes priority
- Multiple matches → Multi-agent coordination
- Unclear context → Requirements analyst activation
- High complexity → System architect oversight
- Quality concerns → Automatic QA agent inclusion

**Selection Decision Tree:**
```
Task Analysis →
├─ Manual @agent-? → Use specified agent
├─ Single Domain? → Activate primary agent
├─ Multi-Domain? → Coordinate specialist agents  
├─ Complex System? → Add system-architect oversight
├─ Quality Critical? → Include security + performance + quality agents
└─ Learning Focus? → Add learning-guide + technical-writer
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Manual Agent Invocation
```bash
# Explicitly call specific agents with @agent- prefix
@agent-python-expert "optimize this data processing pipeline"
@agent-quality-engineer "create comprehensive test suite"
@agent-technical-writer "document this API with examples"
@agent-socratic-mentor "explain this design pattern"
```

### Automatic Agent Coordination
```bash
# Commands that trigger auto-activation
/sc:implement "JWT authentication with rate limiting"
# → Triggers: security-engineer + backend-architect + quality-engineer

/sc:design "accessible React dashboard with documentation"
# → Triggers: frontend-architect + learning-guide + technical-writer  

/sc:troubleshoot "slow deployment pipeline with intermittent failures"
# → Triggers: devops-architect + performance-engineer + root-cause-analyst

/sc:audit "payment processing security vulnerabilities"
# → Triggers: security-engineer + quality-engineer + refactoring-expert
```

### Combining Manual and Auto Approaches
```bash
# Start with command (auto-activation)
/sc:implement "user profile system"

# Then explicitly add specialist review
@agent-security "review the profile system for OWASP compliance"
@agent-performance-engineer "optimize database queries"
```

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting help, see:
- [Common Issues](../Reference/common-issues.md) - Quick fixes for frequent problems
- [Troubleshooting Guide](../Reference/troubleshooting.md) - Comprehensive problem resolution

### Common Issues
- **No agent activation**: Use domain keywords: "security", "performance", "frontend"
- **Wrong agents selected**: Check trigger keywords in agent documentation
- **Too many agents**: Focus keywords on primary domain or use `/sc:focus [domain]`
- **Agents not coordinating**: Increase task complexity or use multi-domain keywords
- **Agent expertise mismatch**: Use more specific technical terminology

### Immediate Fixes
- **Force agent activation**: Use explicit domain keywords in requests
- **Reset agent selection**: Restart Claude Code session to reset agent state
- **Check agent patterns**: Review trigger keywords in agent documentation
- **Test basic activation**: Try `/sc:implement "security auth"` to test security-engineer

### Agent-Specific Troubleshooting

**No Security Agent:**
```bash
# Problem: Security concerns not triggering security-engineer
# Quick Fix: Use explicit security keywords
"implement authentication"              # Generic - may not trigger
"implement JWT authentication security" # Explicit - triggers security-engineer
"secure user login with encryption"    # Security focus - triggers security-engineer
```

**No Performance Agent:**
```bash
# Problem: Performance issues not triggering performance-engineer
# Quick Fix: Use performance-specific terminology
"make it faster"                       # Vague - may not trigger
"optimize slow database queries"       # Specific - triggers performance-engineer  
"reduce API latency and bottlenecks"   # Performance focus - triggers performance-engineer
```

**No Architecture Agent:**
```bash
# Problem: System design not triggering architecture agents
# Quick Fix: Use architectural keywords
"build an app"                         # Generic - triggers basic agents
"design microservices architecture"    # Specific - triggers system-architect
"scalable distributed system design"   # Architecture focus - triggers system-architect
```

**Wrong Agent Combination:**
```bash
# Problem: Getting frontend agent for backend tasks
# Quick Fix: Use domain-specific terminology
"create user interface"                # May trigger frontend-architect
"create REST API endpoints"            # Specific - triggers backend-architect
"implement server-side authentication" # Backend focus - triggers backend-architect
```

**Request Optimization Examples:**
```bash
# Generic (limited agent activation)
"Fix the login feature"

# Optimized (multi-agent coordination)  
"Implement secure JWT authentication with rate limiting and accessibility compliance"
# → Triggers: security-engineer + backend-architect + frontend-architect + quality-engineer
```

### Common Usage Patterns

**Development Workflows:**
```bash
# Full-stack feature development
/sc:implement "responsive user dashboard with real-time notifications"
# → frontend-architect + backend-architect + performance-engineer

# API development with documentation
/sc:create "REST API for payment processing with comprehensive docs"  
# → backend-architect + security-engineer + technical-writer + quality-engineer

# Performance optimization investigation
/sc:troubleshoot "slow database queries affecting user experience"
# → performance-engineer + root-cause-analyst + backend-architect
```

**Analysis Workflows:**
```bash
# Security assessment
/sc:analyze "authentication system for GDPR compliance vulnerabilities"
# → security-engineer + quality-engineer + requirements-analyst

# Code quality review  
/sc:review "legacy codebase for modernization opportunities"
# → refactoring-expert + system-architect + quality-engineer + technical-writer

# Learning and explanation
/sc:explain "microservices patterns with hands-on examples"
# → system-architect + learning-guide + technical-writer
```

### Advanced Agent Coordination
