## Key Framework Concepts

### Meta-Framework Architecture
SuperClaude operates as an enhancement layer for Claude Code through instruction injection rather than code modification, maintaining compatibility while adding sophisticated orchestration capabilities.

### Agent Orchestration
Intelligent coordination of 13 specialized AI agents through communication protocols, decision hierarchies, and collaborative synthesis patterns.

### MCP Integration
Seamless integration with 6 external MCP servers (context7, sequential, magic, playwright, morphllm, serena) through protocol abstraction and health monitoring.

### Behavioral Programming
AI behavior modification through structured `.md` configuration files, enabling dynamic system customization without code changes.

## Documentation Features

### Cross-Referenced Integration
All three documents are strategically cross-referenced, enabling seamless navigation between development workflows, architectural understanding, and testing procedures.

### Accessibility & Inclusivity
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full navigation guidance and diagram descriptions
- **Skill Level Pathways**: Clear progression from beginner to advanced
- **Comprehensive Glossaries**: 240+ technical terms with detailed definitions
- **Learning Resources**: Time estimates and prerequisite guidance

### Consistent Terminology
